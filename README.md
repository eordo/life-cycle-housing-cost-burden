# Life-cycle housing cost burdens

This is an estimation and analysis of life-cycle housing cost burdens in Canada.

## Data

I use the Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs) of the Canadian Income Survey (CIS) from 2012&ndash;22.
The 2017&ndash;22 releases are [available online from Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/72M0003X).
The 2012&ndash;16 releases are archived.

I work with the Stata version of the PUMFs.
The data are expected in this arrangement:

```
data
├── CIS_2012.dta
├── CIS_2013.dta
├── ...
└── CIS_2022.dta
```
